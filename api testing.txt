API Testing workshop:
--------------------
What is API?
• API stands for Application Programming Interface
• APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other 
    using a set of definitions and protocols.
• API contains collections of functions and procedures

Types
• Private AΡΙ
• Public API
• Partner API
• Composite API

What are Web Services?
•A Web service is a software package that is used for communicating between 
two devices or web entities lying on the network.
Types:-
• SOAP Web Services
• REST Web Services

• The abbreviation of SOAP is the Simple Object Access Protocol.
   All its messages are usually in XML format, The SOAP message consists of: Root element, Headers & body
• REST stands for Representational State Transfer,
 It establishes connection over http or https protocol
 (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc.). 
 The allocation of resources in REST depends on the URL & it's
 messages will be in JSON, Text, HTML, XML etc.
 
 Post is non idemoptent
 Http Status code
 
 REST build on top of http protocol
 
 Uniform interface:
	 A group of methods, such as GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE, 
	that are easily understood by the client and server
Stateless: Each request is processed independently from the previous ones

Cacheable: REST is cache friendly and supports multiple formats

Client-server: 
	The server has "resources" that are presented to the client as a representation of the resource's state

Layered system: 
	Individual components cannot see beyond the immediate layer with which they are interacting 





Topic - 01 (API Testing)
-------------------------
What is Postman?
	tool to test rest api
	free to insall and use in production system
	download and just install
	login with ur username/password : gmail
	
• What is API & its types?
	web api: REST api
	
• What are Web Services? & It's types
	REST 
	SOAP
	
• How to Install Postman?
	:)
• What are the other software's required?
	nodejs, npm package manager
	
• Create Collections & Folders
• How to Create First Request in Postman?
• Create GET, POST, PUT & DELETE Requests

Topic - 02 (API Testing)
-------------------------
Negative Scenarios
• How to declare & use Environment Variables?
• How to save response in variable?
• Postman Console - Debugging
• Create automatic API tests?
• Assertions -
• Status code
• Response body contains
• Response header
• Response time

• use Environment Variables?
Environment
	dev test pre prod prod
	
Negative Scenarios
	• Record not found
	• Request has invalid characters
	• Values has to many characters
	• Request sent with missing information
	• Value is not in correct format
	

Ex: How to declare & use Environment Variables?
let we want to use firstname for env variable
let we want to use lastname for env variable

Ex: we will create a new booking 
 "bookingid": 392
 now we want to define bookingid into a variable so that it can be used in all the 
 crud methods
 
var jsonData=pm.response.json();
pm.environment.set("b_id",jsonData.bookingid);
it will set a variable once we run the request

https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/booking/{{b_id}}

Do same for api token used to update the api



Topic - 03 (API Testing)
-------------------------
Advanced Assertions
• JSON Assertion
• Nested JSON Assertion
• Curl Command
• How to execute Collection?
• How to execute folder?
• Exclude tests script from execution
• How to Export Collection?

Topic - 04 (API Testing)
-------------------------
How to install Newman?
• How to execute postman collections?
• How to generate standard html report?
• How to generate advanced html report?

setp 2: install nodejs 
just download and say next.. next

step 2: install newmman (runner to run test cases)
https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman

npm install -g newman

step 3:
npm install -g newman-reporter-html
npm install -g newman-reporter-htmlextra

command to run newman test cases:
-----------------------------------------
newman run Booking_API_testing.json -e dev.postman_env.json
newman run Booking_API_testing.json -e dev.postman_env.json -r html
newman run Booking_API_testing.json -e dev.postman_env.json -r htmlextra

Topic - 05 (API Testing)
-------------------------
• How to Create PATCH API Request?

both used to update the data
put : we send everthing , may not be very effecient
patch: only the data that is requred to be updated is passed on

• How to Verify JSON Schema?
---------------------------------

app1																app2
sending some		verify the data formate
data				------------------------->


Object oriented word?

class and Object:
class  : category		:Trainer
object: like example of that cat...: Rajeev

json data----------------------> json schema
 object								class
 
 before comsuming json data ie recived from other app1
 i should validate the data

Topic - 06 (API Testing)
-------------------------
• Data Driven Testing using JSON file?

REST api testing using postman


how to test soap web service?
-------------------------------
demo how to write the code (Java dev , show some spring boot is a framework to rest rest api)

What is SOAP

2 ways to write web services:
1. REST web services
2. SOAP web services
Simple Object Access protocol

	application1							application2
					--------------------
							xml
		SOAP
		WSDL :web serice description language
		
		
how to write a hello world soap web service:

java dev: java code
		see that feel about it
		
		
Step 1: create a java code to create hello world soap api

step 2: i want to understand wsdl?

		wsdl is aka contract bw 2 parties
		which tell us what web service do and how to call
		how internally it works in not expose
		
		
		
		contract : 
		interface : wsdl looks very similer to a interface aka contract
		
		interface Calculator{
			public int add(int a, int b){
				return a+b;
			}
		}
		
		class Add{
			int a, int b;
		}
		
		class AddResponse{
			int result;
		}
		
		interface Calculator{
			public AddResponse add(Add data){
				return a+b;
			}
		}
		
		<portType name="Calculator">
			<operation name="add">
			<input wsam:Action="http://demo.com/Calculator/addRequest" message="tns:add"/>
			<output wsam:Action="http://demo.com/Calculator/addResponse" message="tns:addResponse"/>
			</operation>
	     </portType>
		 
		 
		 Q: how to test soap api:
		 soap ui smartbear 5.5
		 https://dl.eviware.com/soapuios/5.5.0/SoapUI-5.5.0-windows-bin.zip
		 
		 How to install soap ui:
		 1. download and extract to a folder
		 2. run soapui.bat inside bin folder
		 3. create a soap project and 
		 prvoide the wsdl location
			http://localhost:8080/calapp?wsdl
			
		 4. you will get a way to pass the input 
		 and data is transfer bw two machine in terms of SOAP package 
		 with some too less data + to much data data
		

Request payload: soap is bulky :(
-------------------		

<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:demo="http://demo.com/">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <demo:add>
         <arg0>2</arg0>
         <arg1>7</arg1>
      </demo:add>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>


<S:Envelope xmlns:S="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
   <S:Body>
      <ns2:addResponse xmlns:ns2="http://demo.com/">
         <return>9</return>
      </ns2:addResponse>
   </S:Body>
</S:Envelope>


Q: how to create doc for soap web service
	wsdl file act as documentation: no need to have extra doc
	knowledge to read wsdl correctly
	
		 
		 
		rest: swagger to create doc

	

security

	basics auth: here username and password need to be passed with each request
	jwt token: here rather then username and password we will pass the jwt token
	oauth: mainly use for authorization using 3rd party application
	
	login using facebook
	......
	
Testing JWT based api:
======================

https://survayapi.themetasum.com/swagger/index.html

url for resitering new user:
https://survayapi.themetasum.com/api/Authenticate/Register

url for getting jwt token, u need to login the the app with the username/password you have registered:
https://survayapi.themetasum.com/api/Authenticate/login



calling a secure api:
	1. without token : 401
	2. with valid token : 200 with data
