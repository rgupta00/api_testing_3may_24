API Testing workshop:
--------------------
What is API?
• API stands for Application Programming Interface
• APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other 
    using a set of definitions and protocols.
• API contains collections of functions and procedures

Types
• Private AΡΙ
• Public API
• Partner API
• Composite API

What are Web Services?
•A Web service is a software package that is used for communicating between 
two devices or web entities lying on the network.
Types:-
• SOAP Web Services
• REST Web Services
• The abbreviation of SOAP is the Simple Object Access Protocol.
   All its messages are usually in XML format, The SOAP message consists of: Root element, Headers & body
• REST stands for Representational State Transfer,
 It establishes connection over http or https protocol
 (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc.). 
 The allocation of resources in REST depends on the URL & it's
 messages will be in JSON, Text, HTML, XML etc.




Topic - 01 (API Testing)
-------------------------
What is Postman?
• What is API & its types?
• What are Web Services? & It's types
• How to Install Postman?

Topic - 02 (API Testing)
-------------------------
Negative Scenarios
• How to declare & use Environment Variables?
• How to save response in variable?
• Postman Console - Debugging
• Create automatic API tests?
• Assertions -
• Status code
• Response body contains
• Response header
• Response time

Negative Scenarios
	• Record not found
	• Request has invalid characters
	• Values has to many characters
	• Request sent with missing information
	• Value is not in correct format
	

Ex: How to declare & use Environment Variables?
let we want to use firstname for env variable
let we want to use lastname for env variable

Ex: we will create a new booking 
 "bookingid": 392
 now we want to define bookingid into a variable so that it can be used in all the 
 crud methods
 
var jsonData=pm.response.json();
pm.environment.set("b_id",jsonData.bookingid);
it will set a variable once we run the request

Do same for api token used to update the api
